                Hi, my name is John MIchael Cabrera, a passionate aspiring Software Engineer. What motivates me is the creativity and problem solving that&apos;s involved with working on projects. There&apos;s a feeling that you get when finishing a project. A sense of excitement knowing that you achieved something that not just anybody can do. I recently  graduated with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science from lehman college
                    where I developed the tools needed to work on projects. In a field that&apos;s ever evolving I love to learn new things
